	"description": "Returns Meetup cities. This method supports search by latitude/longitude/radius, by country/state, by query term/zip, or a combination of all of these. Location-only searches by lat and lon return all cities within a radius of the provided coordinates. Searches with a query return up to 10 cities matching the term, and can be sorted by size or distance to a given coordinate. \u0027smart\u0027 ordering can be used to return the match(es) with the highest member_count, unless a smaller size match exists nearby the given coordinates. Query searches are supported for country but not country and state",
